# 360 Reviews

## Intent

The purpose of our 360 reviews system at ChainSafe is a company-wide “Pit Stop” to check in and enable genuine conversations about growth, goals, roles, levels, happiness, satisfaction, concerns, and other matters happening. The gap we aim to close with our review process is to build a culture of meaningful continuous feedback and goal-setting. We will know that our review system is working well when all ChainSafers truly embrace it as a value-adding activity, which empowers them to perform to their full potential. Ultimately this system will extend well beyond reviews and will positively impact team engagement, development, retention, and business results.

## Goals

- Helps us celebrate individual progress and identify opportunities to make even more meaningful contributions
- Hold oneself and each other accountable and aligned around expectations
- Close skill gaps across ChainSafe and increase leadership and manager effectiveness
- Continue to build a culture of continuous feedback and a performance enablement system to facilitate overall organizational effectiveness and success

# Career Development

We want everyone at ChainSafe to have a sense of how they can grow and challenge themselves. From a career perspective, this means providing a clear sense of how an employee can progress within the organization. To facilitate this within Engineering, we have defined 6 levels:

- E1 - Associate Engineer
- E2 - Engineer
- E3 - Senior Engineer
- E4 - Staff Engineer
- E5 - Senior Staff Engineer
- E6 - Principal Engineer

There is some expectation for engineers to move to the next level in a reasonable time frame (~4 years maximum), until they reach E4. Progression from E4 will likely be at the discretion of the individual, based on their own career and life goals.

In order to define these levels and provide a clear sense of expectations we have developed a [**Competency Matrix**](#competency-matrix).

## What is it?

A competency matrix establishes a set of competencies, a scale on which to measure them, and a definition for what each competency looks like at each level.

Some important things to remember about this matrix:

- There will be alternative matrices created for specialized positions such as Engineering Managers, Software Architects etc.
- E6 is intentionally left undefined to give us the ability to distinguish exceptional leaders. We want to highlight the industry and community impact qualifying engineers are expected to have, rather than specific competencies. It's very likely most engineers will never reach E6, unless they position themselves as cornerstones of our industry or communities.

## How is it used?

The competency matrix is meant as a tool to guide the evaluation of engineers. Not all competencies need to be fully met, small deviations are acceptable and should not prevent a promotion if growth overall is clear. It will be employed during 360 reviews to re-assess the current level of each engineer, and may also be used during career development discussions with managers to inform what needs to be achieved to justify a promotion.

The competency levels are intended to compound as you move across the matrix. For example, an E3 is expected to meet all the requirements of an E2. 

Some competencies are only defined up to E3 or E4, for these the expectation is that the highest, defined level should continue to be met for all remaining levels.

## Compensation

The engineering levels are used to inform compensation decisions. The level and the number of years at that level, among others, are key factors in computing compensation.

## Engineering Managers

Within Engineering there are two distinct career tracks - Engineering and Engineering Management. Once an engineer has reached the E3 level they may decide to move into the Engineering Management track. There are several levels (currently loosely defined) for EMs:

- EM3 - Team Lead
- EM4 - Head of Engineering
- EM5 - VP of Engineering

It's expected that as management in Engineering grows there will be additional titles and/or levels introduced.

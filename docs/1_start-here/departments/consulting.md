### Custom software development

We offer the development of products and/or features by a team of experts at ChainSafe. This includes integration with various services and blockchains. At the end of the project, we would deliver clean and readable code along with tests and CI/CD pipelines. Our teams offer experience in various languages and blockchains like:

- Rust
- Go

- Filecoin
- and many more...

Ideal for clients who either have an idea and a need for a team to realize it or clients that wanna help with areas for which they donâ€™t have enough of their resources.

#### Metamask snaps

Metamask snaps is [an upcoming feature](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/snaps.html) that allows anyone to write custom plugins for
Metamask. A most obvious application is adding multichain support to Metamask.
As pioneers in snap development, we already have plenty of experience developing snaps and services related to it.
We already developed a few snaps for major blockchains like:

- https://github.com/chainsafe/filsnap

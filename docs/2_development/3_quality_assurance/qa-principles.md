# Principles

The main objective of QA is to continuously improve development and testing processes in order to reduce the chance of defects arising during the software development life cycle.

- **Quality is everyone's responsibility**. The best results happen when everyone, regardless of role, collaborates closely with a joint objective of delivering high value software. 

- **Plan to succeed**. When a team is aligned and in agreement with a [test plan](/development/quality_assurance/test-plan-guidelines) it adds clarity to the testing process and everyone's role and responsibility within it.
 
- **Prevention > Reaction**. Test early and often in the life cycle and be thorough on pull requests. It's always better to find an issue before it is merged to the repository. 

- **Be explorative and creative**. Consider the different scenarios by which people could be interacting with our software. Test across multiple devices / browsers / resolutions / networks / environments / wallet extensions.

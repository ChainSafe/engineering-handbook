If a repo is owned by ChainSafe there is no reason to fork the repo for pull requests.

# 1. Create a branch off of `main`

Name the branch with your username (or first-name) pre-pended:
`leslie/cool-feature`

# 2. Opening a PR (Pull Request) on Github

When opening a pull request there are two types that can be opened: draft and regular. If you are prepping for a new release, or you are migrating a codebase, opening a draft PR is a great way for publicly showing the current development status of that given milestone. When a branch is feature complete, and has been adequately tested then you should open up a regular PR.

# 3. Writing a title & description

Please make the title clean and concise, preferably explaining what the objective of the pieces of committed code are doing. Some things to know:

- A good example message: `Add support for USD to ETH conversion`

Our repos typically have a template for pull requests, therefore writing the body of a pull request should be straightforward. If the repo doesn't, a clear concise explanation of the changes made should be included in bullet points, and any relevant issues should be closed following the format `Closes #45`.

# 4. Submit for review

- Add the relevant team members (or the team) for review.
- Add the according labels based on the project
- Ensure you adhere to the repositories PR template.
    - If a template is not provided contact you Tech Lead or Project Manager for insights.
- Always ensure you are descriptive, when explaining the nature of your pull request.
